Convert n to characters in s. Section 3.6 and 4.10 of The C Programming Language.

## About the project:
- Two ways to convert n to s:
  - Non-recursively: convert n to s in the reversed order then reverse the string before printing.
  - Recursively: convert n to s by recursively calling printd.

## What did I learn from this:
- Splitting source file into multiple files.
- Recursion in C.
- putchar() to put one char to output stream in C.
- Static internal automatic variables in C.
